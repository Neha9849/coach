## What is 70mm?

Design, build, and deploy a progress dashboard for Digital Public Goods projects as they progress through the lifecycle of becoming a Digital Public Good.

UNICEF’s Innovation Fund is exploring automation and tools to unify different third-party APIs (e.g. GitHub/GitLab, Grimoire Lab, Visible VC, etc.) to create interactive “report cards” about a DPG nominee’s Open Source technology.
The report card shows change over time and monitors progress towards becoming a recognized DPG.
We will build a visual dashboard, using a mix of automatic and manually curated data, to offer an assessment or score of the quality of the Open Source work.
The report card assessments are publicly visible reports that the DPG candidate can use in their Open Source outreach and marketing strategies.


## Impact

Supports the pipeline of enabling early-stage projects and ideas to become Digital Public Goods.
Uses existing resources from the Innovation Fund and the DPG Standard to provide an evaluation and assessment tool.
Reduces manual labor and risk of data inaccuracies by using third-party APIs and persistently storing data.


## Experience required

DevOps engineers that are knowledgeable about:

* Modern web development frameworks like Python Flask/Django, Ruby on Rails, or other comparable web frameworks.
* API development.
* UI/UX skills are a bonus.
